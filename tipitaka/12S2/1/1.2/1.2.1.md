# 𑀆𑀳𑀸𑀭𑀲𑀼𑀢𑁆𑀢 (1.2.1 Āhārasutta)

* 𑀦𑀺𑀤𑀸𑀦𑀲𑀁𑀬𑀼𑀢𑁆𑀢 (Nidānasaṃyutta)

* 𑀆𑀳𑀸𑀭𑀯𑀕𑁆𑀕 (Āhāravagga)

* 𑀆𑀳𑀸𑀭𑀲𑀼𑀢𑁆𑀢 (Āhārasutta)

## Summary

Āhārasutta explains the four āhārā (nutriments) that sustain beings: kabaḷīkāro (food, or edible nutrient), phasso (contact, or experience of stimuli), manosañcetanā (mental volition, or intention), and viññāṇaṃ (consciousness). It describes how the need for these nutriments are caused by paṭiccasamuppāda (dependent origination). The cessation of these underlying causes will lead to the cessation of āhārā.

## Commentary

This is an alternative statement of dependent origination that traces the underlying causes of what is needed to sustain living beings, which is food, stimuli, intention, and consciousness. This is interesting because it implies non-existence is the ultimate release from dukkha, as the need to sustain ourselves inherently causes dukkha. There is a slight problem with this formulation in that phasso (contact, or experience of stimuli) and viññāṇaṃ (consciousness) appear twice in the chain, hence implying viññāṇaṃ is an underlying cause for viññāṇaṃ and phasso is an underlying cause for phasso. This is illustrated in the diagram in the Summary section.
