# Summary

Bālapaṇḍitasutta explains the difference between a wise person and an ignorant person in terms of their understanding and practice of the holy life, which leads to the complete destruction of dukkha. The ignorant person is shrouded in avijjā and taṇhā, and at death and destruction of the body, becomes one who attaches to a new body, unable to escape from dukkha. In contrast, the wise person practices the holy life, abandons avijjā and taṇhā, and at death, is not reborn, thus escaping from dukkha. The sutta highlights the importance of living a holy life for the attainment of liberation from dukkha.

## Commentary

This sutta emphasises the need and the urgency to embrace the soteriology in this lifetime, in order to prevent rebirth, and this is the key difference between an ignorant person and a wise person.
