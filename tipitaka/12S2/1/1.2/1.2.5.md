## Summary

Kaccānagottasutta explores the concept of right view in terms of a middle way (paṭiccasamuppāda) between atthitaṃ (reality) and non-reality. One who sees the world with yathābhūtaṃ (things as they really are) and with sammappaññā (right knowledge) understands that what is not real in the world does not exist, and with cessation of the perceived world what is real in the world does not exist. Grasping non-reality can be avoided by not engaging with adherence or inclination, and without the intention of grasping and attachment.

> “Indeed, Kaccāna, this loko (the world as perceived through our senses), is generally regarded as either atthitaṃ ('real') or natthitaṃ ('non-real'). For one who sees lokasamudayaṃ (the construction of the perceived world) with yathābhūtaṃ (things as they really are) and with sammappaññā (right knowledge), whatever is non-real in the world does not exist. For one who sees lokanirodhaṃ (the cessation of the perceived world) with yathābhūtaṃ and with sammappaññā, what is real in the world (also) does not exist. Indeed, Kaccāna, the perceived world is mostly upayupādānābhinivesavinibandho (engaged through grasping, adherence and attacment). Engaging without the bias of adherence and inclination and without the intention of grasping or attachment, non-reality is not grasped, eg. "my Eternal self".  ‘Only dukkha arises and comes into being, only dukkha ends and ceases to be’, there is no doubt, no uncertainty, no reliance on others, only knowledge. In this respect, Kaccāna, there is sammādiṭṭhi.

With the complete cessation of avijjā, the cessation of saṅkhārā; with the cessation of saṅkhārā, the cessation of viññāṇaṁ…  thus is the cessation of this entirety of dukkha”.

## Commentary

This is an amazingly insightful sutta, with the Buddha explaining that the concept of sammādiṭṭhi ("right view") is avoiding the extremes of regarding everything we perceive as being "real", or "not real", but understanding that our perceived world is constructed and dependent on underlying causes (dependent origination). With the cessation of these causes, dukkha is eliminated from our perceived world. Note that the Buddha is neither implying dukkha is "real" or "not real", but it is constructed, and by ceasing construction, it is no longer perceivable, and therefore cease to exist in our perceived world.
