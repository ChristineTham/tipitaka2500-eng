## Summary

Moḷiyaphaggunasutta discusses the four nutriments for the sustenance of beings, as per [1.2.1 Āhārasutta](1.2.1.md). The sutta explains that these nutriments are causes for the arising of various phenomena, which ultimately lead to dukkha. The Bhagavā emphasises that it is not suitable to ask who consumes these nutriments, but rather what is the cause for these nutriments to be required. The sutta concludes by describing the cessation of the causes ultimately leading to the cessation of dukkha.

And if one were to ask me, ‘Bhante, what is the condition for taṇhā?’ then this would be a suitable question. The suitable answer would be: ‘vedanā is a condition for taṇhā; with taṇhā as condition, there is upādānaṃ.’”

> “Who, Bhante, is upādiyati (the one who grasps)?” “This is not a suitable question,” the Bhagavā said. “I do not say ‘upādiyati.’ If I were to say ‘upādiyati,’ then this would be a suitable question: ‘Who, Bhante, is the one who grasps?’ But I do not say that. And if one were to ask me, ‘Bhante, what is the condition for upādānaṃ?’ then this would be a suitable question. The suitable answer would be: ‘taṇhā is a condition for upādānaṃ; with upādānaṃ as condition, there is becoming.’... Thus is the origin of this entirety of dukkha.

## Commentary

This is an important sutta that extends [1.2.1 Āhārasutta](1.2.1.md) to emphasise that it is invalid to postulate a "self" that is consuming the nutrients, as the "self" itself is constructed. Rather, the nutrients are necessary because of underlying causes, and eliminating these causes will eliminate the requirement for the nutrients.
