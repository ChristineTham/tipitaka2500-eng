## Summary

Timbarukasutta records a conversation between the Buddha and a paribbājako (wandering ascetic) named Timbaruka. Timbaruka asks the Buddha a series of questions about the nature of pleasure and pain, including whether it is made by oneself, another, or spontaneously. The Buddha responds by saying that he does not take these extremes, but instead teaches the Dhamma by the middle, explaining the origin and cessation of dukkha through the chain of dependent origination. Ultimately, Timbaruka is satisfied with the Buddha's explanation and takes the three refuges.

> "Aññā vedanā, añño vedayati." (These feelings, another feels.) - when experiencing feelings, I don't say say "Dukkha is other-made."

## Commentary

This is essentially the same content as [1.2.7 AcelaTimbarukasutta](1.2.7.md) but with dukkhaṃ replaced by sukhadukkhaṃ. It is shorter, but I am not sure the sutta reads as well.
