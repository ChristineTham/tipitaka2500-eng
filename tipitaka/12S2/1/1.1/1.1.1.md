## Summary

Paṭiccasamuppādasutta describes the concept of dependent origination, which explains how dukkha (dissatisfaction) arises from an underlying chain of causes. The cessation of these underlying causes will lead to the cessation of dukkha.

## Commentary

Paṭiccasamuppādasutta, allegedly the thought process that led to the Buddha's realisation, is the central thesis and core of the Buddha's teachings and basis for the soteriology.

The Buddha believed that our viññāṇaṁ (consciousness and sense of "identity" or "self") is "constructed" and ephemeral, and based on the aggregation of saṅkhārā (mental constructions). Furthermore, we are unaware or ignorant of the "constructed" or artificial nature of our consciousness, and hence avijjā (ignorance) is the starting point of Paṭiccasamuppādasutta.

What are mental constructions? These are aggregations of our past experiences, mental states, ideas, thoughts, perceptions, biases, prejudices, everything that make up our "personality" and sense of identity.

Our ignorance of the ephemeral nature of our consciousness is what ultimately leads to dukkha, which is a general dissatisfaction and unease regarding the nature of our existence. We crave for what we cannot have, permanence, comfort and stability but our sense of "self" is impermanent, perennially uncomfortable and unstable.

Paṭiccasamuppādasutta represents a chain of causes that form a cycle. The last component of the chain leads back to the first, and hence the cycle repeats itself ad infinitum.

Paṭiccasamuppādasutta can be modelled as a concentric set of cycles, each representing a process. The processes have increased span and duration as we move outwards from the innermost cycle to the outermost cycle. In theory there are an infinite number of these cycles, but in practice we only need to detail the most significant ones, that can be easily analysed.

The innermost cycle is the span of a single thought process, from it's arising to it's cessation. The next cycle of importance is the span of a single day, representing the arising and cessation of consciousness. After that is the cycle of a single lifetime, and beyond that is the cycle of multiple lifetimes and ultimately the cycle of the universe itself. In between are many other cycles (months, seasons, years, the life and death of stars etc.) but for the purposes of understanding we are less concerned with those.

The following table illustrates how Paṭiccasamuppādasutta works across the different cycles:

| Cause | Thought | Day | Lifetime | Multiple Lifetimes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| avijjā | pre thought "blankness"| awake from sleep | our birth, with no recollection of previous lives | ignorance of previous lives |
| saṅkhārā | previous thoughts | reflections from previous days | mental constructions for this lifetime | constructions are per life |
| viññāṇaṁ | "environment" or context of thought | disposition for the day | consciousness for this lifetime | multiple consciousness, no permanent self |
| nāmarūpaṁ | stimuli or trigger to a thought | daily stimuli | lifetime stimuli | each lifetime has unique identifies and forms |
| saḷāyatanaṁ | perception of stimuli | perception of stimuli | lifetime perceptions | consciousness in each lifetime shaped by unique stimuli |
| phasso | cognizance of stimuli | recognition of experiences | lifetime experiences | symbolic representations or processing of perceptions |
| vedanā | reaction to perception | reaction to experiences| reaction to experiences | transformation of symbolic representations |
| taṇhā | desire, or intention | our wants and needs for the day | lifetime goals and objectives | each lifetime has unique desires |
| upādānaṃ | willpower to execute desire | attachment to wants and needs | survival instinct | each lifetime has it's own "fuel" |
| bhavo | plan of execution | action plan for the day | lifetime path | each lifetime is a unique path or existence |
| jāti | action out of thought process | actions during the day | this existence | rebirth of beings |
| dukkha | results of action, termination of thought | results of actions, followed by sleep | dissatisfaction and death | saṃsāra, or the cycle of rebirths |
