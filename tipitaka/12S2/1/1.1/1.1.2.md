## Commentary

This sutta is a Vibhaṅgasutta, and hence an explanation or analysis of what the Buddha said in the previous sutta (Paṭiccasamuppādasutta). It is written in a style that ascribes the explanation to the Buddha, because the author believes that any text completely consistent with what the Buddha might have said is equivalent to buddhavacana.

However, I note that the text falls into a familiar pattern of overclassifying concepts that reached its peak in the Abhidhamma, and some of the classifications seem like derived ideas (for example, the references to the material and formless existences, the four elements) so overall this sutta was probably composed some time after the Buddha's death.
