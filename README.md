# tipitaka2500-eng

This repository contains work in progress English translations of part of the Tipitaka (Tipitaka 2500 Edition) into English, plus a summary and commentary on each translation. I don't intend to translate all of the Tipitaka, but selections from SN, potentially selections from AN and bits of Abhidhamma.

Only the following texts have been translated so far:

* [12S2 1.1Â Buddhavagga](tipitaka/12S2/1/1.1.md)
